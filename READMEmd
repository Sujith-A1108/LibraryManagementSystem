# 📚 Library Management System

A robust, Java-based desktop application designed to manage library operations efficiently. This system handles book inventory, member registration, and the issuing/returning of books using a MySQL database backend.

## 🚀 Features

* **Book Management:** Add new books, view available stock, and track genres/authors.
* **Member Management:** Register new library members and view their unique Member IDs.
* **Issue System:** Issue books to members with automatic stock validation (prevents issuing out-of-stock books).
* **Return System:** Return books using a unique Transaction ID and automatically update inventory.
* **Search & View:** Real-time tables to view Books, Members, and Active Transactions.
* **Data Persistence:** All data is securely stored in a MySQL relational database.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)
* **GUI:** Java Swing (JFrame, JTable, JTabbedPane)
* **Database:** MySQL Server
* **Connectivity:** JDBC (MySQL Connector/J)
* **IDE:** Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK)**

3.  **MySQL Connector/J** (JDBC Driver added to your project's build path)

## 📥 Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Setup
Open your MySQL Workbench or Terminal and run the following script to create the necessary database and tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_project;
USE library_project;

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    author VARCHAR(100),
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    quantity INT
);

CREATE TABLE members (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    member_id INT,
    issue_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(id)
);
