Library Management System 
A robust, Java Swing-based desktop application designed to manage library operations. This system features a "Strict Mode" logic that handles book issuing, returns, fines, and blocks users based on overdue items or unpaid lost/damaged book penalties.

🚀 Features
Analyitcs Dashboard: Real-time counters for Total Issued, Returned, and Pending books.
Smart Issue System:
Stock Check: Prevents issuing if stock is 0.
Limit Check: Restricts members to a maximum of 2 books.
Strict Blocking: Automatically blocks users who have overdue books (>37 days) or unpaid "Lost/Damaged" fines.
Return & Renew:
Calculates fines automatically (₹10/day after 7 days).
Allows book renewal if within limits.
Lost & Damaged Handling:
Reports incidents (Lost/Damaged).
Grace Period Logic: Allows a 7-day grace period for reported lost books before blocking the user.
Handles payments (₹500 for Lost, ₹300 for Damaged).
Management: Simple forms to add new Books and Members.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java (JDK 8+)
GUI: Java Swing & AWT
Database: MySQL
Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

⚙️ Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
MySQL Server installed and running.
MySQL JDBC Driver (mysql-connector-j-x.x.x.jar) added to your project's classpath.

🗄️ Database Setup (Crucial Step)
The Java code assumes a specific database structure. Run the following SQL commands in your MySQL Workbench or Command Line to set it up:

SQL

CREATE DATABASE library_db;
USE library_db;

-- 1. Create Books Table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    author VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT
);

-- 2. Create Members Table
CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- 3. Create Issue Records Table
CREATE TABLE issue_records (
    issue_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    member_id INT,
    issue_date DATE,
    return_date DATE DEFAULT NULL,
    renewal_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'PENDING', -- PENDING, RETURNED, LOST, DAMAGED, REPORTED_LOST
    fine_amount DOUBLE DEFAULT 0.0,
    payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING', -- PENDING, PAID
    lost_report_date DATE DEFAULT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id)
);


📝 Configuration
Before running the application, ensure the database credentials in LibrarySystem.java match your local MySQL setup:

Java

// Located at the top of LibrarySystem.java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db";
private static final String USER = "root";       // Your MySQL Username
private static final String PASS = "YourPassword"; // <--- CHANGE THIS

🏃‍♂️ How to Run
Clone/Download the repository.
Open the project in an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans).
Add External JAR: Right-click project > Build Path > Add External Archives > Select your mysql-connector-java.jar.
Run the LibrarySystem.java file as a Java Application.

📜 Business Rules (Logic)
Borrow Limit: A member cannot hold more than 2 books at a time.
Fine Calculation: Books are issued for 7 days. After that, a fine of ₹10 per day is calculated.
Overdue Block: If a book is held for more than 37 days (30 days past due), the user is blocked.
Lost/Damaged Block:
Reported Lost: User has a 7-day grace period to pay. After 7 days, they are blocked from borrowing new books.
Confirmed Lost/Damaged: User is blocked immediately until the fine (₹500 or ₹300) is marked as "PAID".

📸 Usage Guide
Dashboard: Check the counters to see library health.
Manage Books/Members: Go to these tabs first to add inventory and users.
Issue Book: Enter Book ID and Member ID. The system will run 3 checks (Stock, Limit, Block Status) before issuing.
Lost/Damaged: If a student reports a lost book, select "Report Only" to start the grace period, or "Pay & Close" to settle it immediately.
